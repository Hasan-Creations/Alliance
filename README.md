# Alliance

Alliance is a personal productivity and life organization web application designed to help you manage your daily life with ease. It features four integrated modules: a To-Do List, a Habit Tracker, a Finance Tracker, and user account management.

Built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, Alliance leverages Firebase for a powerful, real-time backend, including Firebase Authentication for user accounts and Firestore for cloud-native data storage with full offline persistence.

## Key Features

- **Dashboard:** A centralized overview of your pending tasks, habit progress, and financial summaries.
- **To-Do List:** A powerful task manager with priorities, due dates, and sorting capabilities.
- **Habit Tracker:** A tool to build and track habits with a visual history calendar.
- **Finance Tracker:** A comprehensive module to monitor your income and expenses, complete with monthly summaries and category breakdowns.
- **Offline First:** Thanks to Firestore's offline persistence, the app is fully functional without an internet connection. All changes sync automatically when you're back online.
